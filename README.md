HacktoberFest 2021 ðŸ”¥

details Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned contributor or looking for projects to contribute to for the first time, youâ€™re welcome to participate.

Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub or GitLab hosted repository/project. Look for the 'hacktoberfest' topic to know if a repository/project is participating in Hacktoberfest. Pull requests must be approved by a maintainer of the repository/project to count.

You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your pull requests to count.

rules Pull requests can be submitted to any opted-in repository on GitHub or GitLab. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports behavior thatâ€™s not in line with the projectâ€™s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. To get a shirt, you must make four approved pull requests (PRs) on opted-in projects between October 1-31 in any time zone. This year, the first 50,000 participants can earn a T-shirt. A repository/project is considered to be participating in Hacktoberfest if the 'hacktoberfest' topic is present and is accepting public contributions via pull requests. An individual pull request can also be opted-in directly by adding the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label.

A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label. A pull request with any label containing the word 'spam' or 'invalid' will be considered ineligible for Hacktoberfest.
